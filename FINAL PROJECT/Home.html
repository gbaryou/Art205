            <h3 id="His">History</h3>  <img class="home-church-large" src="image/Congregation2.jpg">
            <p>The HCC was founded in 1952 by Rev. Kabash A. Cooper (1909–1980) following his involvement in other churches. Rev. Melvin Dahn as the next General overseer. Melvin Dahn was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Liberia, as at the time he joined the church in 1973. He was ordained a pastor of the church in 1975, and his appointment as the leader (General overseer) of the church was formalized by the posthumous reading of Cooper's sealed pronouncement. In 1990, the Holy Chapel Church Bible School was founded.

In 1981, Pastor Melvin Dahn became the General Overseer of the Church. In 1983, the land for the Redemption Camp in Bassa was purchased. In 1988, a students’ body known as the Holy  Chapel Church Fellowship (HCCF) was established. It is the youth wing of the church concentrated within tertiary institutions of learning in the country. In 1990, Christ the Redeemer’s Friends Universal (CRFU), was established to garner financial and human resources from the very wealthy in the society. In 2005, Chapel's University was established.

Andrew Rice, writing in The New York Times, calls the HCC "one of [Africa's] most vigorously expansionary religious movements. The church's leaders preach that in the future "In every household, there will be at least one member of Holy Chapel Church in the whole world.

In 2008, it had 3,000 churches and 70 thousands members in Liberia, in 9 countries.

The international church is structured in different areas throughout the world. The local churches are now grouped into regions, with 10 Regions in Liberia. It is also organised throughout most of the world. Notable special spiritual programs are the Spiritual Renewal Service which holds on the first Week of every month in Liberia. Then, the annual Spiritual Convention (August) and the Spiritual Congress (December) in Liberia and beyond with diverse schedules.

In 2020, the Liberia Church had 5,000 people.</p>

<h3 id="Bel">Beliefs</h3>
<p>
    
    The official HCC website outlines its beliefs in the Bible and the Holy Trinity, that the Devil exists, that God formed man in his image, in repentance, in cleansing from sins by God's grace, in sanctification, water baptism, Holy Spirit baptism, restitution and that God can heal without medicine (by His divine intervention e.g. through prayer).
