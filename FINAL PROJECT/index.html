            <h3 id="His">History</h3> <img class="home-church-large" src="image/Congregation2.jpg">
            <p>The HCC was founded in 1952 by Rev. Kabash A. Cooper (1909–1980) following his involvement in other
                churches. Rev. Melvin Dahn as the next General overseer. Melvin Dahn was a lecturer in mathematics at
                the University of Liberia, as at the time he joined the church in 1973. He was ordained a pastor of the
                church in 1975, and his appointment as the leader (General overseer) of the church was formalized by the
                posthumous reading of Cooper's sealed pronouncement. In 1990, the Holy Chapel Church Bible School was
                founded.

                In 1981, Pastor Melvin Dahn became the General Overseer of the Church. In 1983, the land for the
                Redemption Camp in Bassa was purchased. In 1988, a students’ body known as the Holy Chapel Church
                Fellowship (HCCF) was established. It is the youth wing of the church concentrated within tertiary
                institutions of learning in the country. In 1990, Christ the Redeemer’s Friends Universal (CRFU), was
                established to garner financial and human resources from the very wealthy in the society. In 2005,
                Chapel's University was established.

                Andrew Rice, writing in The New York Times, calls the HCC "one of [Africa's] most vigorously
                expansionary religious movements. The church's leaders preach that in the future "In every household,
                there will be at least one member of Holy Chapel Church in the whole world.

                In 2008, it had 3,000 churches and 70 thousands members in Liberia, in 9 countries.

                The international church is structured in different areas throughout the world. The local churches are
                now grouped into regions, with 10 Regions in Liberia. It is also organised throughout most of the world.
                Notable special spiritual programs are the Spiritual Renewal Service which holds on the first Week of
                every month in Liberia. Then, the annual Spiritual Convention (August) and the Spiritual Congress
                (December) in Liberia and beyond with diverse schedules.

                In 2020, the Liberia Church had 5,000 people.
                Our story is an interesting but uncomplicated one when you think about all that God can do and has done
                for His children. In the year 2020, there was a global pandemic and people were hurting, confused, and
                upset. Simultaneously, the world was facing a rising civil rights issue, coupled with what turned out to
                be the largest presidential voting in U.S. history. During this perplexing period in life, God decided
                to birth something; The Holy Chapel Church.

            <p>Birthing The Holy Chapel Church was awesome but the way that God decided to do it was even greater.</p>

            We have since learned that the process should be appreciated even when it is puzzling. Our Pastors, Deante
            and Lesa Lavender, who were the campus managers of The Word Church (Akron Location) were called in to sit
            with their man of God, Dr. R.A. Vernon. Within minutes of sitting down, Dr. Vernon said “I feel God telling
            me that I should give you the Akron campus to start your church. You’ve walked with me for years, you’ve
            walked with them, they are familiar with you, they love you, but most of all you love them. This is your
            time.” – Well that’s it!

            No but seriously, at that moment Dr. R.A. Vernon, Dr. Victory Vernon, and the members of The Word Church
            gave us an unimaginable start and step toward our destiny. Drake said (can you mention Drake on a church
            site….we will see what happens) “Started from the bottom, now we’re here.”…that's not our story, but we do
            know that based on how and where we started…we plan on going even further in advancing the message that
            JESUS IS THE REMEDY!</p>

        <p>

            The official HCC website outlines its beliefs in the Bible and the Holy Trinity, that the Devil exists, that
            God formed man in his image, in repentance, in cleansing from sins by God's grace, in sanctification, water
            baptism, Holy Spirit baptism, restitution and that God can heal without medicine (by His divine intervention
            e.g. through prayer).

                Our mission is to spread the love of Jesus Christ and to help individuals find and live in God’s plan
                for their lives and to prepare a people for the Lord from all Nations. The people will in turn build the
                church of the Lord as a kingdom of heaven on earth.
